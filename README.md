# BedrockX

BedrockX is a heavily optimized version of the [Bedrock-Protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol) library made by [PrismarineJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS).

It only provides the client + nethernet support.

I'll not provide any tutorials on how to use BedrockX. You can read the source code to learn how it works.

Let me know of any issues you find, but you probably won't tell me anyways.
