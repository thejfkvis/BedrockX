# BedrockX

BedrockX is a heavily optimized version of the [Bedrock-Protocol](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/bedrock-protocol) library made by [PrismarineJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS).

It only provides the Client along with NETHERNET support.

I'll not provide any tutorials on how to use BedrockX. You can read the source code to learn how it works.

Parts of NETHERNET Support is based off of [Atomic Protocol](https://github.com/AtomicTS/Atomic-Protocol) which is in TS.

Let me know of any issues you find.

## Todo
- Make version in [./src/transforms/serializer.js](https://github.com/thejfkvis/BedrockX/blob/c5621bcdbcce12ba6a7c7c1a7a4342412d58f262/src/transforms/serializer.js#L6) dynamic sometime soon
